<ol>
  <li> An Application Form must be completed in full and submitted together with all required supporting documentation. The Company reserves the right to reject any

  <li> All tariffs charged are inclusive of VAT.  </li>
  <li> Allocation of a Discount Profile will be at the sole discretion of the Company.  </li>
  <li> The Discount Profile will determine the toll plazas at which the Local Commuter Discount is applicable.</li>
  <li> The Local Commuter Discount is only applicable to the Registered Vehicle. Transactions related to any unregistered vehicles will be charged to the commuter at the Nominal Tariff.  </li>

  <li> Upon submission of a new application, the commuter is liable for the card administration fee as prescribed by the Company in the Information Circular, as well as an initial 	 deposit for the establishment of the Minimum Balance, which must be paid for in cash, by bank guaranteed cheque, by means of an electronic funds transfer ("EFT") or by postal order.

  <li>Commuters will not be allowed to top up in the lane with the intention of immediately qualifying for discounted passage. Top Ups will reflect in an account within 48 hours  of payment, depending on when the funds reflect in the Company Bank account.

  <li>Upon cancellation or termination of an LCDC account, the commuter may request in writing for the refund of any unallocated funds remaining in the account. Refunds will be processed within 30 days of an account being closed. Refunds will not be entertained under any other circumstances.</li>

  <li>The application and processing of an LCDC may incur an administration charge as prescribed by the Company in the Information Circular.</li>
  <li>The Company shall not be liable for any misuse that may arise out of the loss or theft of an LCDC.</li>
