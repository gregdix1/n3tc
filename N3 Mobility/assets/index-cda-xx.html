TERMS AND CONDITIONS

An INITIAL Application Form may be submitted at a Concession Office; by fax: to 033 263 1702; posted to P.O. Box 402, Mooi River, 3300 or emailed to concessions@n3tc.co.za.    
2.	All tariffs charged are inclusive of VAT. 
3.	Allocation of a Discount Profile will be at the sole discretion of the Company. 
4.	The Discount Profile will determine the toll plazas at which the Local Commuter Discount is applicable. 
5.	The Local Commuter Discount is only applicable to the Registered Vehicle. Transactions related to any unregistered vehicles will be charged to the commuter at the Nominal Tariff.   
6.	Upon expiry of the Approved Identifier to which it is linked, the Local Commuter Discount shall cease and the Nominal Tariff shall become payable through an alternate Acceptable Payment Method for the Vehicle Class. No refunds or adjustments will be made in respect of any Nominal Tariff paid. 
7.	In the event of an Approved Identifier requiring replacement for any reason whatsoever, a new Application Form must be submitted. Pending the approval of the application, the Nominal Tariff shall become payable through an alternate Acceptable Payment Method for the Vehicle Class. No refunds or adjustments will be made in respect of any Nominal Tariff paid. 
8.	The Local Commuter Discount may be withdrawn at any time at the sole discretion of the Company in the event of any abuse, misuse or other reasonable cause, including 	INITIAL a failure to adhere to any of the Terms and Conditions of Issue and Use. 
9.	The registration number of a vehicle requiring passage will be verified against the Registered Vehicle for the Local Commuter Discount. Where an LCDC is used to facilitate passage of an unregistered vehicle through a toll plaza, the Local Commuter Discount will not be applicable. This shall be deemed to be usage in contravention of these Terms and Conditions and will result in the termination of the Local Commuter Discount, whereupon the Nominal Tariff shall become payable through an alternate Acceptable Payment Method for the Vehicle Class.

Tax Invoices and Usage Reports, where requested and applicable, shall be available for collection 10 working days after the last day of the month to which they relate. Requests for information pertaining to a period older than 30 days may incur additional administrative charges as per the Information Circular. 
11.	Unsuccessful applicants shall be informed at the time of submission of the application at a Concession Office. 
12.	LCDCs may be collected from the nominated Concession Office within one month of notification of a successful application.

15.	A commuter who receives a low balance warning is required to top up by the Minimum Recharge amount before their next passage to prevent disruption to the service.  
16.	When an LCDC account balance is insufficient for one passage, the LCDC will be rejected and the commuter will be charged the Nominal Tariff, payable by an alternate INITIAL Acceptable Payment Method.  
17.	Commuters will not be allowed to top up in the lane with the intention of immediately qualifying for discounted passage. Top Ups will reflect in an account within 48 hours  of payment, depending on when the funds reflect in the Company Bank account. Until the funds are cleared and allocated to the LCDC account, the commuter will be liable INITIAL for the Nominal Tariff. 
18.	Upon cancellation or termination of an LCDC account, the commuter may request in writing for the refund of any unallocated funds remaining in the account. Refunds will be processed within 30 days of an account being closed. Refunds will not be entertained under any other circumstances.

23.	The application and processing of an LCDC may incur an administration charge as prescribed by the Company in the Information Circular. 
24.	The Company shall not be liable for any misuse that may arise out of the loss or theft of an LCDC.
